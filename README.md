Hi Professor,

My name is Fabian Reginold and I'm from Bangalore, India.
I've been working as a data scientist at Oracle Cloud for nearly 3 years now. Before that, I did my Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering.
My hobbies are playing the piano and keyboard.

I'm familiar with Python programming for machine learning. With that said, I really loved the class today and I learnt a lot today.

I'm looking forward to learning lot's of new content in this class and would be happy to learn new technologies.

Thank You.

Hi Professor,

My name is Fabian Reginold and I'm from Bangalore, India.
I've been working as a data scientist at Oracle Cloud for nearly 3 years now. I also have an Electronics and Communication Engineering Bachelor's degree from India.
My hobbies are playing the piano and keyboard at concerts.

I'm familiar with Python programming for machine learning. With that said, I really loved the class today and I learnt a lot today.

I'm looking forward to learning lot's of new content in this class and would be happy to learn new technologies.

Thank You.
